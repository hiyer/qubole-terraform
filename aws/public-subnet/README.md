# Public Subnet Configuration

This template creates a VPC for use with Qubole clusters in a public subnet based on the [VPC Scenario 1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario1.html).

To see the list of required and configurable inputs for the template, see [here](variables.tf). Any variable that does not have a default value is a required input.
